# Pooltime ![cutedeadpoolq](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4770ae08-6d5a-4951-a211-ec3f2470ab9c)


My own Scratch game inspired by **Oscartime**, built as part of **CS50x 2025 – Week 0 (Scratch)**.  

For my very first program, I decided to redesign the classic *Oscartime* by creating new sprites and adding my own twist. This project was not only fun but also a way to put some of Week 0’s concepts into practice — especially the characteristics of pseudocode such as functions, boolean expressions, loops, and more.  

## 📂 Files
- `Pooltime.sb3` — the Scratch project file  

## 🚀 Reflection
Building Pooltime helped me practice **computational thinking** and apply the basics of designing algorithms without writing “real code.” It showed me how logic and flow control can turn simple blocks into interactive gameplay.
